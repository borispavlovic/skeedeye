Yet another iPhone & iPod media grabber. Works only with jailbroken iPhones with installed SSH support over WI-FI. It discovers plugged in iPods. Exposes simple user interaface to enter searching criteria, iPhone's IP and 'root' user password, selecting output folder and start/stop grabbing.

Written in Java, uses multithreading to paralellize the workload.
